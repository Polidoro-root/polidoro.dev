Today I'm releasing my first blog and as every programmer the first thing that we do in unknown lands is the classic "Hello World". So, here it is!

The main goal of this blog is to keep on track my experiences and self development as tech professional. To create this blog I got inspired by many brazilian developers that I have followed since I started my career, the most notable ones are [Wesley Willians](https://fullcycle.com.br/blog/), [Fabio Akita](https://www.akitaonrails.com) and [Elton Minetto](https://eltonminetto.dev), but there are a lot more from Brazil and outside.

First I wanna share things that don't necessarily fit in company production code, I'll try to explore my development setup, customized home network and other interesting projects that I've used to learn some concepts like Data Structure, Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks and Math.

I hope you enjoy it like I did!
